I wondered, <em>Who could this angel be?</em> I was eager to meet the media girl who was so remarkable that even the boss highly recommended her.</p>

<p>Then I saw you. As I looked into your eyes, countless questions began to fill my mind. <em>Could this girl share the same dreams as me?</em> I wanted to know so much about you, and I couldn't help but feel that we needed to meet again.</p>

        <p>Spaghetti, your favorite food, feels even more special when I imagine us sharing it together. The thought of us laughing over a plate of pasta fills me with joy and excitement.

She always goes above and beyond to make me happy, doing everything she can to please me, even in the smallest ways. Her thoughtfulness and care never go unnoticed.</P>

        <p>What I love most about Arike is how she trusts me with her worries, always sharing her thoughts and feelings openly. She gives me hope and inspires me to be the best version of myself every day. No matter how busy life gets, she always creates time for me, making me feel valued and loved. Her gratitude for even the smallest gestures reminds me how lucky I am to have her in my life. Arike truly is my greatest blessing.</P>";
